# DeepStream SAHI

Native GStreamer plugins that integrate **SAHI** (Slicing Aided Hyper Inference) into NVIDIA DeepStream for real-time small-object detection in high-resolution video streams.

> **Inspired by [SAHI](https://github.com/obss/sahi)** — the original framework-agnostic sliced inference library by OBSS. This project implements the SAHI slicing and GreedyNMM merging algorithms as native C++ GStreamer plugins for zero-copy, GPU-accelerated inference within DeepStream pipelines.

## Highlights

- **nvsahipreprocess** — Dynamically computes SAHI slices per frame, crops and scales each slice on GPU via `NvBufSurfTransform`, and prepares tensors for `nvinfer`.
- **nvsahipostprocess** — Merges duplicate detections at slice boundaries using the GreedyNMM algorithm (IoU/IoS metrics). Operates entirely on `NvDsObjectMeta` — no tensor access, no CUDA.
- **Drop-in pipeline integration** — Fits between `nvstreammux` and `nvinfer` (preprocess) and between `nvinfer` and `nvtracker` (postprocess).

```
nvstreammux → nvsahipreprocess → nvinfer → nvsahipostprocess → nvtracker → nvdsosd
```

## Quick Start

> **Note:** This repository uses [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/) to store ONNX model files (~97 MB each). Make sure Git LFS is installed before cloning so the models are downloaded automatically.

```bash
# Install Git LFS (once per machine)
git lfs install

# Clone — ONNX models are pulled automatically via Git LFS
git clone https://github.com/levipereira/deepstream-sahi.git
cd deepstream-sahi

# Launch DeepStream container (see docs/INSTALL.md for full options)
docker run -it --name deepstream-sahi --net=host --gpus all \
    -v `pwd`:/apps/deepstream-sahi -w /apps/deepstream-sahi \
    nvcr.io/nvidia/deepstream:8.0-triton-multiarch

# Inside the container — single command installs everything:
/apps/deepstream-sahi/install.sh

# Download test videos into python_test/videos/ (see link below)
# Activate Python environment and run
source /opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream/sources/deepstream_python_apps/pyds/bin/activate
cd python_test/deepstream-test-sahi
python3 deepstream_test_sahi.py --model visdrone-full-640 --no-display --csv ../videos/aerial_crowding_01.mp4
```

> **Test Videos:** Download the aerial surveillance test videos from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CRLnuH9AtTwmxRz7z-Mtu6ErKx__VMK4) and place them in `python_test/videos/`. You can also use your own videos.

## Modified DeepStream Libraries

### nvdsinfer — Smart Engine File Caching

Adds intelligent TensorRT engine file naming and auto-discovery. Instead of rebuilding the `.engine` file on every pipeline start, it generates a standardized name encoding batch size, input dimensions, GPU model, compute capability, TensorRT version, and precision:

```
{model}_b{batch}_i{W}x{H}_{compute_cap}_{gpu}_{trt_ver}_{precision}.engine
```

See [`ENGINE_FILE_NAMING_FEATURE.md`](deepstream_source/libs/nvdsinfer/ENGINE_FILE_NAMING_FEATURE.md) for the full specification.

### nvdsinfer_yolo — YOLO Custom Bounding-Box Parser

Custom parsing functions for YOLO models exported with **EfficientNMS_TRT** and **EfficientNMSX_TRT + ROIAlign_TRT** TensorRT plugins:

| Function | Model Type |
|----------|-----------|
| `NvDsInferYoloNMS` | Detection |
| `NvDsInferYoloMask` | Instance Segmentation |

## SAHI is a Full-Pipeline Strategy

The performance gains above come not just from the inference plugins, but from **adapting the entire training pipeline** to work with SAHI:

- The **sliced-448 model** was trained on pre-sliced images (fine-tuned from the full-640 model in just 40 epochs), achieving **mAP@0.5 of 0.859** on sliced validation data — compared to 0.485 for the full-frame model on full images.
- A smaller network input (448 vs 640) means **faster inference per slice**, while SAHI guarantees objects always appear at the right scale.
- With more training epochs and potentially even smaller inputs (320×320), there is significant room to improve both accuracy and throughput.

The key insight: **reducing the model input size does not hurt accuracy when combined with SAHI** — it improves throughput while SAHI handles the scale problem.

The GELAN-C architecture used here was chosen to isolate and validate the plugins, not because it is optimal for this use case. The real opportunity is lighter, purpose-built models. For instance, [Zhu & Xie (2026)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-026-35301-2) achieve **+4.6% mAP50 on VisDrone while reducing parameters by ~8.5%** with an enhanced YOLOv11n. Combined with SAHI slicing, architectures like that could deliver better accuracy with significantly less GPU per inference — making this approach especially compelling for edge deployments.

See the [Training Guide](docs/TRAINING.md) for details.

## Disclaimer

These plugins were developed as a proof of concept and have **not been thoroughly tested for all scenarios**. In particular:

- Only single-source pipelines have been validated. **Multi-source** configurations and other combinations with additional DeepStream components have not been tested.
- The code may contain bugs or limitations that surface in production environments or non-standard pipeline configurations.

This is an open-source project provided as-is. I do not have the availability to actively maintain it. **Contributions are welcome** — feel free to fork, fix, improve, and submit pull requests. Please respect the applicable licenses for each component.
