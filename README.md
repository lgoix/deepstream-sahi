Native GStreamer plugins that integrate **SAHI** (Slicing Aided Hyper Inference) into NVIDIA DeepStream for real-time small-object detection in high-resolution video streams.

> **Inspired by [SAHI](https://github.com/obss/sahi)** — the original framework-agnostic sliced inference library by OBSS. This project implements the SAHI slicing and GreedyNMM merging algorithms as native C++ GStreamer plugins for zero-copy, GPU-accelerated inference within DeepStream pipelines.

## Highlights

- **nvsahipreprocess** — Dynamically computes SAHI slices per frame, crops and scales each slice on GPU via `NvBufSurfTransform`, and prepares tensors for `nvinfer`.
- **nvsahipostprocess** — Merges duplicate detections at slice boundaries using the GreedyNMM algorithm (IoU/IoS metrics). Operates entirely on `NvDsObjectMeta` — no tensor access, no CUDA.
- **Drop-in pipeline integration** — Fits between `nvstreammux` and `nvinfer` (preprocess) and between `nvinfer` and `nvtracker` (postprocess).

```
nvstreammux → nvsahipreprocess → nvinfer → nvsahipostprocess → nvtracker → nvdsosd
```

## What Makes It Different

DeepStream SAHI does not run as a separate Python inference workflow. Slicing,
inference, and post-processing run as native GStreamer plugins inside the
DeepStream pipeline, keeping the full path close to GPU memory.

- **TensorRT-native inference** through `nvinfer` for lower latency and higher throughput.
- **Dynamic multi-stream support** with `nvmultiurisrcbin`, including URI-based sources and runtime add/remove workflows.
- **Full DeepStream compatibility** with tracking, analytics, messaging, and on-screen display components.

This makes SAHI a production-friendly DeepStream building block rather than an
external add-on around the pipeline.

## Results

All tests on **2560×1440 aerial surveillance video** | **NVIDIA RTX 5080** | **FP16** | **Batch 16**

### SAHI vs No SAHI — Detection Improvement

#### visdrone-full-640 (640×640, full-frame trained)

| Video | Scene | No SAHI | SAHI | Improvement |
|-------|-------|---------|------|-------------|
| aerial_crowding_01 | Dense pedestrian crowd | 13.8 obj/frame | **84.2** obj/frame | **+510%** |
| aerial_crowding_02 | Very dense crowd | 206.2 obj/frame | **664.7** obj/frame | **+222%** |
| aerial_vehicles | Dense vehicle traffic | 92.3 obj/frame | **252.5** obj/frame | **+174%** |

#### visdrone-sliced-448 (448×448, SAHI-aware trained)

| Video | Scene | No SAHI | SAHI | Improvement |
|-------|-------|---------|------|-------------|
| aerial_crowding_01 | Dense pedestrian crowd | 2.3 obj/frame | **85.3** obj/frame | **+3,619%** |
| aerial_crowding_02 | Very dense crowd | 35.9 obj/frame | **614.9** obj/frame | **+1,613%** |
| aerial_vehicles | Dense vehicle traffic | 28.6 obj/frame | **226.7** obj/frame | **+694%** |

> The sliced-trained model (448×448) benefits dramatically more from SAHI because its native resolution is too small for 2560×1440 input. Without SAHI, small objects are invisible. With SAHI slicing, the model operates at its intended scale.

### Full-Frame vs Sliced Training — Both with SAHI

| Video | full-640 + SAHI | sliced-448 + SAHI | Difference |
|-------|----------------|------------------|------------|
| aerial_crowding_01 | 84.2 | 85.3 | +1.3% |
| aerial_crowding_02 | 664.7 | 614.9 | -7.5% |
| aerial_vehicles | 252.5 | 226.7 | -10.2% |

> With SAHI enabled, both training strategies converge to comparable detection counts. The full-frame model has a slight edge on large objects that span multiple slices.

## Modified DeepStream Libraries

### nvdsinfer — Smart Engine File Caching

Adds intelligent TensorRT engine file naming and auto-discovery. Instead of rebuilding the `.engine` file on every pipeline start, it generates a standardized name encoding batch size, input dimensions, GPU model, compute capability, TensorRT version, and precision:

```
{model}_b{batch}_i{W}x{H}_{compute_cap}_{gpu}_{trt_ver}_{precision}.engine
```

See [`ENGINE_FILE_NAMING_FEATURE.md`](deepstream_source/libs/nvdsinfer/ENGINE_FILE_NAMING_FEATURE.md) for the full specification.

### nvdsinfer_yolo — YOLO Custom Bounding-Box Parser

Custom parsing functions for YOLO models exported with **EfficientNMS_TRT** and **EfficientNMSX_TRT + ROIAlign_TRT** TensorRT plugins:

|----------|-----------|

## SAHI is a Full-Pipeline Strategy

The performance gains above come not just from the inference plugins, but from **adapting the entire training pipeline** to work with SAHI:

- The **sliced-448 model** was trained on pre-sliced images (fine-tuned from the full-640 model in just 40 epochs), achieving **mAP@0.5 of 0.859** on sliced validation data — compared to 0.485 for the full-frame model on full images.
- A smaller network input (448 vs 640) means **faster inference per slice**, while SAHI guarantees objects always appear at the right scale.
- With more training epochs and potentially even smaller inputs (320×320), there is significant room to improve both accuracy and throughput.

The key insight: **reducing the model input size does not hurt accuracy when combined with SAHI** — it improves throughput while SAHI handles the scale problem.

The GELAN-C architecture used here was chosen to isolate and validate the plugins, not because it is optimal for this use case. The real opportunity is lighter, purpose-built models. For instance, [Zhu & Xie (2026)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-026-35301-2) achieve **+4.6% mAP50 on VisDrone while reducing parameters by ~8.5%** with an enhanced YOLOv11n. Combined with SAHI slicing, architectures like that could deliver better accuracy with significantly less GPU per inference — making this approach especially compelling for edge deployments.

See the [Training Guide](docs/TRAINING.md) for details.

## Disclaimer

These plugins were developed as a proof of concept and have **not been thoroughly tested for all scenarios**. In particular:

- Only single-source pipelines have been validated. **Multi-source** configurations and other combinations with additional DeepStream components have not been tested.
- The code may contain bugs or limitations that surface in production environments or non-standard pipeline configurations.

This is an open-source project provided as-is. I do not have the availability to actively maintain it. **Contributions are welcome** — feel free to fork, fix, improve, and submit pull requests. Please respect the applicable licenses for each component.
